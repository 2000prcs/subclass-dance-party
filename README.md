# Subclass Dance Party
> An exploration in polymorphism and inheritance.

When constructing applications, it is often the case that you will need to construct objects that share common methods or traits. Dancers, for example, all display individual unique traits, however they also share the ability to dance, to stop dancing, and to line up. By creating dancers that are subclasses of a Dancer class, you can exhibit individuality while allowing your dancers to inherit useful methods from their superclass. This ability of the Dancer class to manifest in various subclass forms is polymorphism.
